		<p>&ldquo;Dear Parents and Carers</p>

		<p><b>Christmas Concert</b></p>

<p>I hope you all had a good break over half term.</p><br>

<p>We have had to change the date of the Christmas concert to <b>Sunday 18 December</b>. We had
hoped to get St Giles Cripplegate for Sunday 11 December but unfortunately we were unable
to. I’m hoping that this change will not be inconvenient for you. There were other venues
available for the 11 th but they are not nearly as beautiful as St Giles, so I’ve taken a chance
and hope that you will be able to bring them on the 18 th .</p>

<p>The timings will be confirmed with the church but at the moment there will be a rehearsal in
the afternoon from 2.00 – 3.45pm (younger ones will come at 3pm) and then the concert will
be from 5.30 – 6.30pm. I will confirm these times with you shortly but they are unlikely to
change much, if at all.</p>

<p>This means that we will have an extra music centre session on Sunday 11 December.</p>

<p>Kind regards</p>
		
		<p>Richard&rdquo;</p>
