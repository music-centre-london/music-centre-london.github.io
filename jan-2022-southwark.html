		<p><b>6th January 2022</b></p>

		<p>&ldquo;Dear Parents and Carers</p>

		<p><b>Happy New Year!</b></p>

		<p>I thought the children and young people were magnificent in the Christmas concert; many
congratulations to them again.</p>

<p>We have a busy year ahead of us and I will be sending out news of various exciting events
over the next few weeks. It is essential that we have your correct contact details so please
don’t forget to let us know if you change your phone numbers, email or address. We are
hoping to move away from WhatsApp this year towards email as our preferred method of
contact. Please could you make sure we have your latest email address; you can either bring
it in typed on a piece of paper or email me at <a href="mailto:richard@musiccentrelondon.com">richard@musiccentrelondon.com</a>. Remember
that the latest letters will always be posted up on the website <a href="www.musiccentrelondon.com">www.musiccentrelondon.com</a></p>

<p>We’re looking forward to seeing you all on Sunday 9th January at the same times as last term.
If you need a reminder of your time just email me at <a href="mailto:richard@musiccentrelondon.com">richard@musiccentrelondon.com</a> and I’ll
let you know immediately.</p>

		<p><b>Dates for the term:</b></p>
		
		<p>January 9, 16, 23, 30;  February 6, 27;  March 6, 13, 20, 27.</p>
		
		<p><b>An apology</b></p>

<p>As you know, we had hoped to be all set up for bank transfers this term. I can assure
you it’s not been for want of trying! In order to make these changes you have to
complete online mandates and wait to hear from the bank. There are a number of
changes we want to make to our accounts, including a change of signatory, which has
to be done first (otherwise we’ll run out of cheques). It is now 6 weeks since I
completed the mandate and sent it off and it is impossible to speak to anyone. The
record for waiting in line on the phone is 2 hours and 45 minutes! I’ve also tried
speaking to a human at the local branch and they just refer you online, which I’ve
already tried. Many apologies. I’m not giving up! If anyone knows of a bank that
actually does stuff, please let me know. So it’s cheques and cash again I’m afraid.
Maybe next term….</p>

<p><b>Interviews</b></p>

<p>I’m working out the schedule now and will let you now how it’s going to work next
week.</p>

<p>See you on Sunday. Can’t wait.</p>

<p>Kind regards</p>
