			<h4>User anonymity and personal information</h4>
			
			<p>Log files are maintained and analysed of all requests for files on this website&rsquo;s web servers. Log files do not capture personal information but do capture the user&rsquo;s IP address, which is automatically recognised by our web servers.</p>

			<p>Aggregated analysis of these log files is used to monitor website usage. These analyses may be made to available to Music Centre London (MCL) staff and partner agencies to allow them to measure, for example, overall popularity of the site and typical user paths through the site.</p>

			<p>Except as stated already,MCL will make no attempt to identify individual users. You should be aware, however, that access to web pages will generally create log entries in the systems of your ISP or network service provider. These entities may be in a position to identify the client computer equipment used to access a page. Such monitoring would be done by the provider of network services and is beyond the responsibility or control of MCL.</p>

			<p>MCL will make no attempt to track or identify individual users, except where there is a reasonable suspicion that unauthorised access to systems is being attempted. In the case of all users, MCL reserves the right to attempt to identify and track any individual who is reasonably suspected of trying to gain unauthorised access to computer systems or resources operating as part of MCL web services.</p>

			<p>All log file information collected by MCL is kept secure and no access to raw log files is given to any third party.</p>
