<p>‘We are thrilled and honoured that MCL pupils will be performing in a
choir of 400 London children in front of Buckingham Palace on 5 June
and that our very own Richard Frostick will be conducting the event.
The choir – called ‘Kids’ Choir – have been rehearsing for months and
are sounding wonderful. Kids’ Choir will open the event at 2.00pm
so make sure you’re near a tv to catch them.</p>
<p>
In April another group of singers performed with international opera
superstar Joyce DiDonato at the Barbican in her two ‘Eden’ concerts.
We were all bowled over by Joyce’s charm and modesty and, of course,
completely mesmerised by her beautiful singing. The concerts received
5* reviews and the audience were clearly very moved by the wonderful
children’s chorus at the end. Stand by for some great photos!’</p>

<p>Kind regards</p>
