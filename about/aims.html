			<p><i>&ldquo;I was a Trustee of The Music Centre for over a decade. I became involved to support Richard and his team's dedication to the provision of high quality music education for Islington's young people from all backgrounds â€” education provided through vibrant and diverse group singing and drumming. A few years ago The Music Centre expanded into Southwark to create a service based on exactly same principles, also shaped by the unique needs and aspirations of that borough's young population.</i></p>
	 
			<p><i>Ever since its inception in 1992 this wonderful organisation has maintained its core objectives and principles despite ever-changing political, educational and voluntary sector landscapes. The Music Centre remains today what it's been from the start: a really good thing!</i></p>
			 
			<p><i>As a parent I am proud and grateful: I watched my own children (now 25 and 21) develop their love for, and confidence in, performing music at the highest level from age 5 to 18. They are both active musicians today and I'm certain that the pleasure they give, and derive, from their music will remain a foundation stone throughout their lives.</i></p>
			 
			<p><i>As a musician I am impressed and inspired: Richard and the team's commitment to the highest musical quality and diversity is unswerving; their belief that 5 to 18 year-old young people with wide-ranging experience can engage together to make challenging and collaborative music is evidenced every week, and regularly showcased in both local and national performances.</i></p>
			 
			<p><i>I am simply pleased to have been part of such a wonderful force for good and to continue to be able to lend a hand.&rdquo;</i></p>
