			<p>My tutelage at Music Centre London begun at age 5 at the Islington Centre and came to a close at age 19 by which time I had performed with the Music Centre at The Royal Albert Hall, The Barbican Centre, 10 Downing Street, The Houses of Parliament and Portcullis House amongst other venues. </p>

			<p>Growing up the Music Centre was instrumental in forming me as a person, especially during the transition between primary and secondary school as I went to a secondary school without any pre-existing friends from my primary. But having a group of friends and adults that I know I could trust and recognise every Saturday made the transition far easier.</p>

			<p>Musically the Music Centre equipped me with a lot of the tools that I still use to this day, from a steady foundation in singing to workshops in which I acquired rhythmic skills as well as providing an open forum for me and my fellow choir members to be creative; to more advanced skills such as sight reading and vocal blending within an ensemble. In my case these skills were certainly transferable as they helped me to succeed at music A level (A*). As well as ensemble work there were always opportunities for solos and singing in such a supportive environment definitely raised my confidence to then sing in front of public audiences.</p>

			<p>I am now continuing my training under Richard Frostick in this tremendous scheme that is giving me the skills to be able to teach people of all ages the tools that I now take for granted. I shadow him at both the Islington and Southwark centres as well as beginning to do some singing leadership within the centres myself. I believe these leadership skills should be a part of any musicians arsenal as they give you the firm belief that you can stand in front of an ensemble of any kind and lead them effectively.</p>

			<p>Alongside my work with the Music Centre I am pursuing an exciting career as a singer, songwriter and all-round general musician.</p>
