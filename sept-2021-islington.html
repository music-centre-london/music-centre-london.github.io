		<p><b>5th September 2021</b></p>

		<p>&ldquo;Dear Parents and Carers</p>

		<p><b>Welcome back!</b></p>

		<p>I hope you’ve had a decent break; we’re so looking forward to seeing you all on Saturday 18 September.</p>

		<p><b>Dates</b></p>
		
		<p>Here are the dates for the coming term: 18, 25 September; 2, 9, 16 October; 6, 13, 20, 27 November; 4, 11 (concert) December.</p>
		
		<p>Please come at the same time as last term. You will receive a WhatsApp reminding you of this. After half term there will be some adjustments. We will be interviewing new pupils this term and I will let you know the arrangements for this shortly.</p>
		
		<p><b>Communications</b></p>
		
		<p>As you know, we intend to become as paper-free as possible this term. <b>Please
could you type your email address on a piece of paper for us and bring it in
on the first day.</b> We can then start to update our database.</p>
		
		<p>Please could you use email to get in touch: <a href="mailto:richard@musiccentrelondon.com">richard@musiccentrelondon.com</a>
I will check it before every choir on Saturday and regularly during the week.
You will get a prompt reply. Please check the website regularly for updates:
<a href="http://www.musiccentrelondon.com">www.musiccentrelondon.com</a>. We will continue to WhatsApp you for a while
longer to remind you to check the website.</p>
		
		<p><b>Health and Safety</b></p>
		
		<p>Please wear masks when you enter and leave the school. The pupils will not
wear masks in choir. We will continue to be very careful. The children and
young people will be seated well away from each other and the glass doors will
be wide open, no matter what the weather! So please send them with an extra
sweater or two when the weather cools down! If your child is unwell please
keep them at home. If there is a positive test in the family or among your
contacts please let me know immediately and I can make an appropriate
decision.</p>
		
		<p>See you on the 18th!</p>
		
		<p>Best wishes</p>
		
		<p>Richard&rdquo;</p>
