				<h3><p>May 2022 - Music Centre young singers will follow their April <b>Jovce DiDonato</b> triumph at the Barbican with a performance in the <b>Platinum Jubilee Pageant Choir</b> in front of <b>Buckingham Palace on 5 June!</b></h3></p>
				<p><h3><b><a href="/may-2022-jubilee/">Click here for details</a></b></h3></p>
				
				<p>Over the last 25 years more than 3,000 children and young people have received music tuition at our two centres. We are regularly oversubscribed and there is no doubt that we are a popular and successful enterprise. We have found a way to support the music education of children and young people that is both effective and appealing.</p>

				<p>Why is the provision so successful? We are less interested in creating the next young superstar and more concerned with how to help each and every one of our pupils reach their potential. Though many of our young people now have successful careers in the performing arts and a few have found fame, we're not primarily interested in creating famous people. We are interested in creating young musicians.</p>

				<p>Making music with other people is one of the greatest of human experiences, and one that can enrich lives like nothing else. Whatever our young people go on to do, they leave the Music Centre knowing that they will always be able to make music. Those of us that have music in our lives know what that means!</p>
