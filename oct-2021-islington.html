		<p>Dear Parents and Carers</p>

		<p><b>Reminder</b></p>

		<p>We will not be meeting for the weekends either side of half-term so will look
forward to seeing you next on <b>Saturday 6 November.</b></p>

		<p>Here is a reminder of the dates for the second half of the term:
<b>6, 13, 20, 27 November; 4, 11 (Concert) December.</b></p>
		
		<p><b>Some choir changes</b></p>
		
		<p>We will be putting some of the choirs together in order to make space for the
new choirs next term. I will contact you individually about these changes next
week by phone or message, so that you know the correct time to come on the 6th .
If you donâ€™t hear from me please come at your usual time.</p>
		
		<p><b>Interviews</b></p>
		
		<p>Application forms will be prepared and sent out next half term and the
interviews will take place during January and February. We will also be
accepting digital applications for the first time.</p>

		<p>I will let you have details of the venue and final timings immediately after half term.</p>
		
		<p>Have a good half-term break!</p>
