		<p><i>&ldquo;Dear Parents and Carers</i></p>

		<p><i>Here are the final details for our re-opening on 12th (Islington) and 13th (Southwark) June.</i></p>

		<p><i>Islington parents should have all received a WhatsApp message confirming the choir that your
child is in and the time.  Southwark parents will receive a phone call from us over the next few days confirming
your choirs and times.  All the timings of the choirs are listed below.  If you have not heard from us
please email richard@musiccentrelondon.com and we will contact you to confirm your choir and time.</i></p>

		<p><i>For all of us, health and safety are of course particularly important at this time.  Please arrive promptly and 
stay two metres apart as you queue.  We will have extra volunteers so you shouldn’t have to wait too long.
Please follow the one way directions and wear a mask at all times.  The children do not have to wear masks.</i></p>
		
		<p><i>Please impress on the children how important it is that they follow our instructions carefully. When you come to pick
up, we will follow the same procedure in reverse.</i></p>
		
		<p><i>It will be worth it!</i></p>
		
		<p><i>A word about fees.  Like many small organisations we have been hit very hard by the pandemic financially.
Some of our expenses continued even though we were without our usual income.  We fully understand that 
many of you too have been adversely affected in this way, but if you can possibly afford to make additional
donations at this time we would be very grateful.  One way of doing this would be to pay for a whole term, or
you may be able to make a smaller additional donation.  We will continue to provide free places for those in need.</i></p>
		
		<p><i>See you on the weekend of 12th and 13th June.</i></p>
		
		<p><i>Kind regards</i></p>
		
		<p>Richard&rdquo;</p>
