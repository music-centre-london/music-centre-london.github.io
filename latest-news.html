		<p><i>&ldquo;Dear Parents and Carers</i></p>

		<p><i>I’m absolutely delighted to tell you that we will be re-starting music centre sessions on the weekend of 
		12 and 13 June.   Islington will be at Laycock on Saturday 12 June and Southwark at Charles Dickens on
		Sunday 13 June.  We will run the sessions for five consecutive weeks from then:</i></p>

		<p><i>Islington: 12, 19, 26 June; 3, 10 July.</i></p>

		<p><i>Southwark: 13, 20, 27 June; 4, 11 July.</i></p>

		<p><i>For everyone’s safety, these sessions will be very tightly run.  We will observe social distancing and masking
		advice for adults during drop-off and pick-up and the children and young people will be two metres apart during the session.  All the doors
		onto the playgrounds will be open; good ventilation is essential and will be maintained at all times.  I know that you will respect me and our staff
		by following this advice very strictly.  Our main aims are, of course, to relax, learn and have fun - but it must be safe fun.</i></p>

		<p><i>I will post another message on this website shortly with all the timings. There will be some changes because the advice is
		that we should not go above 30 pupils in any one choir group.</i></p>

		<p><i>We would appreciate it if any parents or carers with current DBS clearance could volunteer for an hour or two during the day
		to be an extra pair of hands and eyes as we start back.  If you can spare the time, please email me asap at <a href="mailto:richard@musiccentrelondon.com">richard@musiccentrelondon.com</a></p> 
		<p>Please also email me if you are NOT able to attend next half term.  We have a number of pupils waiting to start and it would be good to
		fill any empty spaces.</i></p>

		<p><i>I can’t wait to see you all.</p>

		<p><i>Warm regards</i></p>

		<p>Richard&rdquo;</p>
