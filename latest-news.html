		<p><i>&ldquo;Dear Music Centre community</i></p>

		<p><i>It’s now nine months since we were all together and I would like to thank you for the many good wishes
		that we’ve received over that period.  I know that you are missing our sessions and it seems so cruel that at a time
		when singing and performing music together would have been a particularly welcome support for us all, we are having to resist the temptation 
		to meet.  I too am missing our work together more than I can say.  Suffice to say that every time I've started to
		think about ways that we could start some face-to-face sessions the ground has shifted.
		I continue to take advice from a number of reputable sources and they consistently advise against live singing sessions as things are at
		the moment.  I’m sure you will understand that we have a duty of care to the whole Music Centre community and we cannot initiate
		any activity that may bring risk to children, young people, parents or staff, and their dependents.</i></p>

		<p><i>As I write we are entering a very challenging period and it's unlikely that we will be able to start again until the summer term.  Rest assured that
		as soon as I'm informed that it’s safe to start again I will act very quickly.  This website - musicentrelondon.com - is now live again and we will text you to tell you when
		there is a new message.  Please check the website now and again anyway, just in case you don’t get our texts.  You can also email me at richard@musiccentelondon.com
		and I will reply as soon as I can.</i></p>

		<p><i>I’m going to start a youtube channel so that our children and young people can learn some new material.  I will also include some warm-up exercises to help them
		keep their voices in trim.  I’ll let you know as soon as this is up and running.

		<p><i>I feel particularly sad that the young people who were coming up to their final Music Centre concert at the Union Chapel were so unceremoniously abandoned.
		I would like to say to them that I will certainly reschedule that concert as soon as I can and we will find a way to get together.  If you’re now at college or university
		away from London then I can look at the possibility of running a holiday course for you, leading up to a performance.  Many of you have been loyal and supportive
		members of our community for 12 years and I will make sure you are not forgotten.  If you have had to delay your start in higher education, then by all means come
		back to us when we resume.  I'd like to know how you're getting on, so please email me at the above address.

		<p><i>Meanwhile, look after yourselves and here’s wishing you all the very best for an increasingly good 2021.&rdquo;</i></p>

		<p>Richard</p>
