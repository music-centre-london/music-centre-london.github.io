		<p><b>7th September 2022</b></p>

		<p>&ldquo;Dear Parents and Carers</p>

		<p><b>Starting Back</b></p>

<p>I hope you all had a wonderful holiday! Here are the dates for the Autumn Term:</p><br>

11, 25 September<br>
2, 9, 16 October<br>
6, 13, 20, 27 November<br>
4 December<br>
<b>Concert: 11 December</b><br>

<p>Please come at the same time as you did last term until half-term, when we will be
reorganizing the choirs.</p>

<p><b>Thames Festival 2022</b></p>

<p>The children who sang in the Jubilee Pageant performance will be singing again at the
Thames Festival on Sunday 18 September, with some additional pupils. I will be
notifying their families individually about the final arrangements for this.</p>

<p><b>Joyce DiDonato Eden Project</b></p>

<p>An additional perk to having been involved in that memorable concert at the Barbican
last term is that are going to have two visits from top professional harpist and workshop
leader Xenia Horne. The first of these workshops will be on Saturday 24 September. I
will let you know the final timings shortly.</p>

<p><b>Interviews</b></p>

<p>Schools are about to be notified via email and the application process will be mainly
online, although we will still accept paper applications in special circumstances. A flier
is also being prepared and I will be asking you to help me distribute these.
Looking forward to seeing you all next Sunday, 11 September.</p>

<p>Kind regards</p>
		
		<p>Richard&rdquo;</p>
