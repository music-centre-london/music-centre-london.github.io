		<p>Dear Parents and Carers</p>

		<p><b>Christmas Concert</b></p>

		<p>Here are the details for the Christmas Concert on Saturday 11 December.
It will be at St Giles Cripplegate church, which is right in the middle of the
Barbican complex, a short walk from the main concert hall. Its postcode is
EC2Y 8DA. If you type that into your search you should immediately get a good
map. If you would like me to print one out for you let me know. The nearest
tube is Barbican, but you can go to Moorgate. There are also numerous buses
that go there. If you drive, you could park in the main Barbican car park,
but of course there would be a charge.</p>

		<p>The timings for Saturday 11 December are as follows:</p>
		
		<p><b>Rehearsal:</b> 3 – 5pm for all choirs EXCEPT the pupils in the choir that comes
from 11.45am – 12.30pm who – being younger - will rehearse for one hour only, from
3 – 4pm. Please collect them promptly at 4. The other choirs will rehearse until
5. There are many places to have something to eat and relax in the Barbican
Centre until they return at 5.30pm, ready for the...</p>
		
		<p><b>Concert: 6 – 7.15pm</b></p>
		
		<p>There are no tickets for the concert but we will be taking a collection afterwards.  
If you are able to make a donation that would be greatly appreciated at this time.
We hope to be able to offset the £600 hire fee for the church.</p>
		
		<p>The children and young people are sounding wonderful. 
		This will be a very special concert. 
		If you are able to be an extra pair of eyes and hands on the day please let us know, particularly if you have DBS clearance.</p>
		
		<p>From today I will be giving out song sheets and hope that they will learn as many of the words as possible. 
		A folder will help to keep them fresh, so please could they bring one from now on.</p>
		
		<p>Kind Regards</p>
		
		<p>Richard</p>
